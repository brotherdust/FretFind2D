### Known Issues

1. **Browser Compatibility**: Some features depend on modern browser APIs
   - File downloads require the Blob constructor API
   - Older browsers may not support all features

2. **UI/UX Limitations**:
   - Interface is functional but dated in appearance
   - Dense UI with many parameters may overwhelm new users
   - Limited mobile responsiveness

3. **Technical Limitations**:
   - Large, complex designs may impact performance
   - Some calculations can be processor-intensive
   - jQuery dependency was removed (5/11/2025); some specific UI interactions (e.g., radio buttons, text input behavior with automated browser testing tools) require manual verification post-refactor.

4. **Design Constraints**:
   - "Individual" string scaling is still marked as experimental
   - Limited validation of extreme parameter values
   - No undo/redo functionality for design changes

- [ ] Consider additional visualization options (e.g., simplified 3D view, instrument body preview)

### Long Term Goals: Advanced Functionality & Project Evolution
- [ ] Implement a generic string tension calculator
- [ ] Develop vendor-specific string tension libraries (potentially pulling from public datasheets)
- [ ] Create offline tooling to normalize and ingest string vendor data
- [ ] Implement vendor-aware string tension modeling
- [ ] Build a "best-fit" solver to recommend string gauges based on target tension or feel
- [ ] Evaluate renaming the project if functionality significantly expands beyond fretboard design

- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Examples gallery with common instrument types
- [ ] Build documentation for luthiers

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Decisions
- **Client-Side Processing**: The decision to keep all processing client-side has proven effective, enabling offline usage and eliminating server dependencies.
- **Modular Design**: The separation of geometric primitives, fretboard modeling, and rendering systems has maintained code clarity. This was further enhanced by refactoring into multiple JS files (May 2025).
- **URL Parameter System**: The approach of encoding designs in URLs has successfully enabled design sharing without server storage.

### Technical Choices
- **SVG.js for Visualization**: Replaced Raphael.js (5/11/2025) for vector graphics, offering modern features. (Previously Raphael.js)
- **jQuery**: Removed entirely and replaced with vanilla JavaScript (as of 5/11/2025). Previously jQuery 3.7.1.
- **JavaScript Modularity**: Refactored monolithic `fretfind.js` and `fretfind_ui.js` into a set of smaller, more focused modules under `src/core/`, `src/output/`, and `src/ui/` directories, plus a setup file `src/ff_setup.js` (May 2025). This improves maintainability and clarity.
- **Output Format Diversity**: The decision to support multiple output formats has successfully served diverse user needs.

### User Experience Decisions
- **In-Context Help**: The approach of providing detailed help alongside form elements has effectively supported users.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate visualization updates on parameter changes has been essential for the interactive design process.
- **Toggleable Display Options**: Allowing users to control visualization elements has proven useful for different use cases.

### Development Methodology Decisions
- **Structured Guidelines (`.clinerules/`)**: Adoption of explicit rules for commits, tool usage, and workflows to ensure consistency and quality in ongoing development and maintenance.
- **Memory Bank System**: Implementation of a formal Memory Bank to capture and persist project knowledge, crucial for long-term maintainability and onboarding, especially in environments with context resets.
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Leveraging Model Context Protocol servers for Git, documentation (Context7), and structured problem-solving (Sequential Thinking) to streamline development tasks and improve efficiency.

## Next Development Priorities

Should development continue, these are the top recommended priorities, focusing on immediate impact and foundational improvements (derived from Short Term Goals):

1.  **Migrate Core Dependencies**: Address technical debt by reviewing/updating remaining outdated libraries (Raphael.js replaced, jQuery removed).
2.  **Modernize UI & Implement Responsive Design**: Improve the user interface for current standards and ensure usability across devices.
3.  **Refactor Code to Modern JavaScript Patterns**: Continue enhancing code maintainability and performance (jQuery-related refactoring complete, initial modularization complete).
4.  **Improve Fretboard Visualization**: Make the visual output more appealing and easier to understand.
5.  **Support Fractional Inches**: Add support for fractional inch measurements for input and output, a key UX improvement for many users.
