# Progress: FretFind2D

## Current Status

FretFind2D is a fully functional application that successfully fulfills its core purpose of designing fretboards for string instruments with support for multi-scale and microtonal designs. The project is in a mature state with all planned features implemented and working correctly. Recent efforts have focused on formalizing development processes, including the establishment of detailed project guidelines (`.clinerules/`) and a comprehensive Memory Bank system to ensure consistent and well-documented contributions.

### What Works

#### Core Functionality
- ✅ Single scale length fretboard design
- ✅ Multiple scale length (fan fret) design
- ✅ Individual string scale length (experimental)
- ✅ Equal temperament scales with configurable number of divisions
- ✅ Just intonation via Scala file format import
- ✅ Customizable string count, widths, and spacing
- ✅ Configurable fretboard dimensions and parameters
- ✅ Interactive, real-time visualization

#### Output Formats
- ✅ SVG export
- ✅ PDF export (single page)
- ✅ PDF export (multi-page with configurable page size)
- ✅ DXF export for CAD software
- ✅ HTML table output
- ✅ CSV data export
- ✅ TAB delimited data export

#### User Experience
- ✅ Real-time visualization with parameter updates
- ✅ Sharable/bookmarkable designs via URL parameters
- ✅ Comprehensive in-app help documentation
- ✅ Multiple measurement unit support (inches, cm, mm)
- ✅ Adjustable display options for visualization

#### Development Tools
- ✅ Git MCP server integration for version control operations
- ✅ Context7 MCP server for accessing up-to-date library documentation
- ✅ Sequential Thinking MCP server for structured problem-solving
- ✅ Updated custom commands for MCP tools usage
- ✅ Standardized workflow for library documentation retrieval
- ✅ Docker configuration for consistent local development environment

#### Project Management & Process
- ✅ Establishment of comprehensive project guidelines (`.clinerules/`) covering commit standards, MCP tool usage, development workflows, and progress tracking.
- ✅ Implementation of a structured Memory Bank system for maintaining project knowledge and context.

### Known Issues

1. **Browser Compatibility**: Some features depend on modern browser APIs
   - File downloads require the Blob constructor API
   - Older browsers may not support all features

2. **UI/UX Limitations**:
   - Interface is functional but dated in appearance
   - Dense UI with many parameters may overwhelm new users
   - Limited mobile responsiveness

3. **Technical Limitations**:
   - Large, complex designs may impact performance
   - Some calculations can be processor-intensive
   - jQuery dependency is an older version (1.4.2)

4. **Design Constraints**:
   - "Individual" string scaling is still marked as experimental
   - Limited validation of extreme parameter values
   - No undo/redo functionality for design changes

## What's Left to Build

While the core application is complete, there are several potential enhancements that could be considered:

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] UI modernization with responsive design
- [ ] Library updates (jQuery, etc.)
- [ ] Additional visualization options (3D view, instrument preview)
- [ ] Design preset library for common instrument types
- [ ] Sound preview based on design parameters
- [ ] More comprehensive parameter validation
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality

### Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Getting started guide for beginners
- [ ] Video tutorials
- [ ] Examples gallery with common instrument types
- [ ] Build documentation for luthiers

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Decisions
- **Client-Side Processing**: The decision to keep all processing client-side has proven effective, enabling offline usage and eliminating server dependencies.
- **Modular Design**: The separation of geometric primitives, fretboard modeling, and rendering systems has maintained code clarity.
- **URL Parameter System**: The approach of encoding designs in URLs has successfully enabled design sharing without server storage.

### Technical Choices
- **Raphael.js for Visualization**: Has proven effective for vector graphics but could be replaced with modern alternatives.
- **jQuery**: Was appropriate at the time of development but could be updated or replaced.
- **Output Format Diversity**: The decision to support multiple output formats has successfully served diverse user needs.

### User Experience Decisions
- **In-Context Help**: The approach of providing detailed help alongside form elements has effectively supported users.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate visualization updates on parameter changes has been essential for the interactive design process.
- **Toggleable Display Options**: Allowing users to control visualization elements has proven useful for different use cases.

### Development Methodology Decisions
- **Structured Guidelines (`.clinerules/`)**: Adoption of explicit rules for commits, tool usage, and workflows to ensure consistency and quality in ongoing development and maintenance.
- **Memory Bank System**: Implementation of a formal Memory Bank to capture and persist project knowledge, crucial for long-term maintainability and onboarding, especially in environments with context resets.
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Leveraging Model Context Protocol servers for Git, documentation (Context7), and structured problem-solving (Sequential Thinking) to streamline development tasks and improve efficiency.

## Next Development Priorities

Should development continue, these would be the recommended priorities:

1. **Technical Modernization**:
   - Update dependencies to current versions
   - Refactor code to use modern JavaScript patterns
   - Improve responsive design for mobile devices

2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Streamline parameter input for common use cases
   - Add preset designs for popular instrument types
   - Improve visualization with more realistic rendering

3. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Finalize the experimental individual string scaling feature
   - Add additional temperament and scale options
   - Implement sound preview functionality
