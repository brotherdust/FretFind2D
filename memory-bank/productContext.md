# Product Context: FretFind2D

## Problem Statement
Traditional fretboard design tools have significant limitations:
- Most only calculate positions along a single string
- Few can handle multi-scale designs (fan frets) effectively
- Most can't properly model microtonal scales
- Many lack proper visualization tools
- Output options are typically limited

Luthiers and instrument designers need a comprehensive tool that can model the entire fretboard as a 2D system and handle non-standard designs.

## Target Users

### Primary: Luthiers and Instrument Makers
- Professional instrument builders who need precise measurements for custom designs
- Require multiple output formats for integration with CAD/CAM software
- Need reliable calculations for non-standard fretboard configurations
- Value visual confirmation of designs before cutting materials

### Secondary: Experimental Musicians
- Musicians exploring microtonal music who want to design custom instruments
- Artists experimenting with multi-scale instruments
- Researchers in music technology and tuning systems
- DIY instrument builders

## User Experience Goals

### Clarity
- Provide immediate visual feedback for design changes
- Clearly display measurements and calculations
- Offer comprehensive help text for complex concepts
- Make the relationship between inputs and outputs transparent

### Flexibility
- Support multiple measurement units
- Allow for various scale length configurations
- Enable custom temperaments and tunings
- Provide multiple output formats

### Accessibility
- Work across different platforms without installation
- Operate entirely in the browser
- Function offline when needed
- Share designs easily via URLs

## User Journey

1. **Initial Design Configuration**
   - Select scale length approach (single, multiple, or individual)
   - Configure string count and basic dimensions
   - Set fretboard properties (nut width, bridge width, etc.)

2. **Refinement**
   - Adjust temperament settings (equal or just)
   - Fine-tune string spacing and fretboard overhang
   - Set display options (show/hide elements)

3. **Visualization**
   - Review the visual representation of the fretboard
   - Check the measurements in the data tables
   - Make iterative adjustments as needed

4. **Output Generation**
   - Export in desired format (PDF, SVG, DXF, etc.)
   - Save design via URL for later reference or sharing
   - Use the generated files in fabrication process

## Success Criteria
- Users can accurately design multi-scale fretboards
- Microtonal scales are properly implemented
- Generated output files are compatible with common CAD/CAM software
- Designs can be saved and shared easily
- Interface is intuitive for both beginners and professionals
- Application runs reliably across different browsers
